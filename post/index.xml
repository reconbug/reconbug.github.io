      <title>Using Asciidoc for Web Development</title>

      <description>During the day, I work with content management tools and support documentation writers who&amp;#8217;s preferred language of choice is Asciidoc. It has a simple syntax, but enough features to keep even a hard core documentation nerd happy. With Asciidoc, you can write documentation in a more natural way and mark it up cleanly for presentation on the web or as a PDF. This got me thinking, &#34;Wouldn&amp;#8217;t it be handy to be able to maintain a website purely with Asciidoc?</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;#8217;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;#8217;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
 We&amp;#8217;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Go is for lovers! Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.</description>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>
